# Microservices practice by Waldo Sobrino

## Get started

You will find a `docker-compose.yml` in the repo.

Run the following command to set up a container:
```
docker-compose up --detach
```
That will setup a container with two images:
- postgres
- rabbitmq

Users can be found in `docker-compose` file.

Regards,
Waldo.
